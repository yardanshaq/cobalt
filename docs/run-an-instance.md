# how to run a cobalt instance
## using docker compose and package from github (recommended)
to run the cobalt docker package, you need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed and configured.

if you need help with installing docker, follow *only the first step* of these tutorials by digitalocean:
- [how to install docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial-collections/how-to-install-and-use-docker)
- [how to install docker compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial-collections/how-to-install-docker-compose)

## how to run a cobalt docker package:
1. create a folder for cobalt config file, something like this:
    ```sh
    mkdir cobalt
    ```

2. go to cobalt folder, and create a docker compose config file:
    ```sh
    cd cobalt && nano docker-compose.yml
    ```
    i'm using `nano` in this example, it may not be available in your distro. you can use any other text editor.

3. copy and paste the [sample config from here](examples/docker-compose.example.yml) and edit it to your needs.
    make sure to replace default URLs with your own or cobalt won't work correctly.

4. finally, start the cobalt container (from cobalt directory):
    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

if you want your instance to support services that require authentication to view public content, create `cookies.json` file in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`. example cookies file [can be found here](examples/cookies.example.json).

cobalt package will update automatically thanks to watchtower.

it's highly recommended to use a reverse proxy (such as nginx) if you want your instance to face the public internet. look up tutorials online.

## run cobalt api outside of docker (useful for local development)
requirements:
- node.js >= 18
- git
- pnpm

1. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt`.
2. go to api/src directory: `cd cobalt/api/src`.
3. install dependencies: `pnpm install`.
4. create `.env` file in the same directory.
5. add needed environment variables to `.env` file. only `API_URL` is required to run cobalt.
    - if you don't know what api url to use for local development, use `http://localhost:9000/`.
6. run cobalt: `pnpm start`.

### ubuntu 22.04 workaround
`nscd` needs to be installed and running so that the `ffmpeg-static` binary can resolve DNS ([#101](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/issues/101#issuecomment-1494822258)):

```bash
sudo apt install nscd
sudo service nscd start
```

## list of environment variables for api
| variable name         | default   | example                 | description |
|:----------------------|:----------|:------------------------|:------------|
| `API_PORT`            | `9000`    | `9000`                  | changes port from which api server is accessible. |
| `API_LISTEN_ADDRESS`  | `0.0.0.0` | `127.0.0.1`             | changes address from which api server is accessible. **if you are using docker, you usually don't need to configure this.** |
| `API_URL`             | ➖        | `https://api.cobalt.tools/` | changes url from which api server is accessible. <br> ***REQUIRED TO RUN THE API***. |
| `API_NAME`            | `unknown` | `ams-1`                 | api server name that is shown in `/api/serverInfo`. |
| `API_EXTERNAL_PROXY`  | ➖        | `http://user:password@127.0.0.1:8080`| url of the proxy that will be passed to [`ProxyAgent`](https://undici.nodejs.org/#/docs/api/ProxyAgent) and used for all external requests. HTTP(S) only. |
| `CORS_WILDCARD`       | `1`       | `0`                     | toggles cross-origin resource sharing. <br> `0`: disabled. `1`: enabled. |
| `CORS_URL`            | not used  | `https://cobalt.tools`  | cross-origin resource sharing url. api will be available only from this url if `CORS_WILDCARD` is set to `0`. |
| `COOKIE_PATH`         | not used  | `/cookies.json`         | path for cookie file relative to main folder. |
| `PROCESSING_PRIORITY` | not used  | `10`                    | changes `nice` value* for ffmpeg subprocess. available only on unix systems. |
| `FREEBIND_CIDR`       | ➖        | `2001:db8::/32`         | IPv6 prefix used for randomly assigning addresses to cobalt requests. only supported on linux systems. see below for more info. |
| `RATELIMIT_WINDOW`    | `60`      | `120`                   | rate limit time window in **seconds**. |
| `RATELIMIT_MAX`       | `20`      | `30`                    | max requests per time window. requests above this amount will be blocked for the rate limit window duration. |
| `DURATION_LIMIT`      | `10800`   | `18000`                 | max allowed video duration in **seconds**. |
| `TUNNEL_LIFESPAN`     | `90`      | `120`                   | the duration for which tunnel info is stored in ram, **in seconds**. |
| `TURNSTILE_SITEKEY`   | ➖        | `1x00000000000000000000BB` | [cloudflare turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) sitekey used by browser clients to request a challenge.\*\* |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET`    | ➖        | `1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA` | [cloudflare turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) secret used by cobalt to verify the client successfully solved the challenge.\*\* |
| `JWT_SECRET`          | ➖        | ➖                      | the secret used for issuing JWT tokens for request authentication. to choose a value, generate a random, secure, long string (ideally >=16 characters).\*\* |
| `JWT_EXPIRY`          | `120`     | `240`                  | the duration of how long a cobalt-issued JWT token will remain valid, in seconds. |
| `API_KEY_URL`         | ➖        | `file://keys.json`      | the location of the api key database. for loading API keys, cobalt supports HTTP(S) urls, or local files by specifying a local path using the `file://` protocol. see the "api key file format" below for more details.  |
| `API_AUTH_REQUIRED`   | ➖        | `1`                     | when set to `1`, the user always needs to be authenticated in some way before they can access the API (either via an api key or via turnstile, if enabled). |
| `API_REDIS_URL`       | ➖        | `redis://localhost:6379` | when set, cobalt uses redis instead of internal memory for the tunnel cache. |
| `API_INSTANCE_COUNT`  | ➖        | `2`                     | supported only on Linux and node.js `>=23.1.0`. when configured, cobalt will spawn multiple sub-instances amongst which requests will be balanced. |
| `DISABLED_SERVICES`   | ➖        | `bilibili,youtube`       | comma-separated list which disables certain services from being used. |

\* the higher the nice value, the lower the priority. [read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix)).

\*\* in order to enable turnstile bot protection, all three **`TURNSTILE_SITEKEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET`** need to be set.

#### FREEBIND_CIDR
setting a `FREEBIND_CIDR` allows cobalt to pick a random IP for every download and use it for all
requests it makes for that particular download. to use freebind in cobalt, you need to follow its [setup instructions](https://github.com/imputnet/freebind.js?tab=readme-ov-file#setup) first. if you configure this option while running cobalt
in a docker container, you also need to set the `API_LISTEN_ADDRESS` env to `127.0.0.1`, and set
`network_mode` for the container to `host`.

## api key file format
the file is a JSON-serialized object with the following structure:
```typescript

type KeyFileContents = Record<
    UUIDv4String,
    {
        name?: string,
        limit?: number | "unlimited",
        ips?: (CIDRString | IPString)[],
        userAgents?: string[]
    }
>;
```

where *`UUIDv4String`* is a stringified version of a UUIDv4 identifier.
- **name** is a field for your own reference, it is not used by cobalt anywhere.

- **`limit`** specifies how many requests the API key can make during the window specified in the `RATELIMIT_WINDOW` env.
    - when omitted, the limit specified in `RATELIMIT_MAX` will be used.
    - it can be also set to `"unlimited"`, in which case the API key bypasses all rate limits.

- **`ips`** contains an array of allowlisted IP ranges, which can be specified both as individual ips or CIDR ranges (e.g. *`["192.168.42.69", "2001:db8::48", "10.0.0.0/8", "fe80::/10"]`*).
    - when specified, only requests from these ip ranges can use the specified api key.
    - when omitted, any IP can be used to make requests with that API key.

- **`userAgents`** contains an array of allowed user agents, with support for wildcards (e.g. *`["cobaltbot/1.0", "Mozilla/5.0 * Chrome/*"]`*).
    - when specified, requests with a `user-agent` that does not appear in this array will be rejected.
    - when omitted, any user agent can be specified to make requests with that API key.

- if both `ips` and `userAgents` are set, the tokens will be limited by both parameters.
- if cobalt detects any problem with your key file, it will be ignored and a warning will be printed to the console.

an example key file could look like this:
```json
{
    "b5c7160a-b655-4c7a-b500-de839f094550": {
        "limit": 10,
        "ips": ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.42.42"],
        "userAgents": ["*Chrome*"]
    },
    "b00b1234-a3e5-99b1-c6d1-dba4512ae190": {
        "limit": "unlimited",
        "ips": ["192.168.1.2"],
        "userAgents": ["cobaltbot/1.0"]
    }
}
```

if you are configuring a key file, **do not use the UUID from the example** but instead generate your own. you can do this by running the following command if you have node.js installed:
`node -e "console.log(crypto.randomUUID())"`
