- added support for tiktok (images won't work, they're only accessible through the app)
- hopefully main input bar is now not rounded on ios, i fucking hate apple
- if service is not supported, a correlating error will appear, not generic one
- removed duplicates from config that are present in package json already
- tiny bit of clean up
