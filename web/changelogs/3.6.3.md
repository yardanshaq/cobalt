changelog popup no longer annoys you after a major update! this action has been replaced with a notification dot. if you see a red dot, then there's something new.

your old setting that disabled the changelog popup now applies to notifications.

new users will see a notification dot instead of an about popup, too. this was mostly done to prevent complications if your browser is set up to clean local storage when you close it.

other changes:
- popups are now a bit wider, just so more content fits at once.
- better interface scaling.
- code is a bit cleaner now.
- changed twitter api endpoint. there should no longer be any rate limits.
