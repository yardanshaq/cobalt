here's what's up:
- tiktok images are saved as .jpeg instead of .webp (finally, i know).
- added support for image downloads from douyin.
- fixed tiktok audio downloads from the image picker.
- emoji in about button now changes on special occasions. be it halloween or christmas, cobalt will change just a tiny bit to fit in :D

if you're not caught up with new stuff in cobalt 4.x yet, check out the previous changelog down below. there's a ton of stuff to like.
