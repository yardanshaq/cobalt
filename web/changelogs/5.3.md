this update isn't as big as previous ones, but it still greatly enhances the cobalt experience.

here's what's up:
- new mode switcher! elegant and 100% clear. should no longer cause any confusion. let me know if you like it better this way :D
- wide paste button on mobile is back, but now it's even closer to your finger.
- removed the weird grey chin on changelog banners.
- removed left-handed layout toggle since it is no longer needed.
- fixed input area display in chromium 112+.
- centered the main action box.
- cleaned up css of main action box to get rid of tricks and ensure correct display on all devices.
- fixed a bug that'd cause notifications dots to disappear when an unrelated checkbox was checked.

hopefully from now on i'll focus on adding support for more services.
thank you for using cobalt. stay cool :)
