hey! there have been some hiccups in cobalt's stability lately, i was going through finals while trying to scale up the infrastructure, and that didn't really work out, lol.
BUT i'm happy to announce that i've optimized all nodes! <span class="text-backdrop">there should no longer be any networking issues</span>.

enjoy stable experience while i work in background to make cobalt even better :)

here's what's new in this update:
- better button contrast in both themes. 
- button highlight in light theme now actually looks like a highlight.
- removed ip gate for streamables and updated privacy policy to reflect this change.
- streamable links now last for 20 seconds instead of 2 minutes.
- cleaned up stream verification algorithm. now the same function doesn't run 4 times in a row.
- removed deprecated way of hosting a cobalt instance.

thank you for sticking with cobalt, and i hope you have a great day :D
